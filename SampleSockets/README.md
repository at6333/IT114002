This sample has the barebones of a multi-user chatroom from the command line.
Users can pick names then join the public chat.
Users can join/leave freely without impacting the server.
Usernames and messages get filtered through a blacklist pulled from https://www.freewebheaders.com/bad-words-list-and-page-moderation-words-list-for-facebook/.
In my sample, any detected blacklisted word will get replaces with a random "silly" word (just for giggles).
